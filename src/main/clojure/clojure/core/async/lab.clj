  "core.async HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL feature exploration

  Caveats:

  1. Everything defined in this namespace is experimental, and subject
  to change or deletion without warning.

  2. Many features provided by this namespace are highly coupled to
  implementation details of core.async. Potential features which
  operate at higher levels of abstraction are suitable for inclusion
  in the examples.

  3. Features provided by this namespace MAY be promoted to
  clojure.core.async at a later point in time, but there is no
  guarantee any of them will."
