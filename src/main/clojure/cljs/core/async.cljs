  'unsub'. Each topic will be handled by an internal mult on a
  dedicated channel. By default these internal channels are
  unbuffered, but a buf-fn can be supplied which, given a topic,
  creates a buffer with desired properties.

  Each item is distributed to all subs in parallel and synchronously,

  buffering/windowing to prevent slow subs from holding up the pub.

  Items received when there are no matching subs get dropped.
